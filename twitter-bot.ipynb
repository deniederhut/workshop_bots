    "\n",
    "You can test code. You can use it to collect data. On Twitter, you can use a bot to post automated status updates. You can even use a bot can alert you when certain events happen (inside or outside of Twitter).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the D-Lab, we pull training/workshop information from our calendar, generate a tweet, and post it to the @DLabAtBerkeley account. We're trying to add more functionality, such as including instructor usernames in the tweets or processing the descriptions and titles to come up with a short, descriptive summary.\n",
