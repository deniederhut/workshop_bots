# workshop_bots
A repository for an upcoming D-Lab workshop on Twitter bots.

We've created a shared account: https://twitter.com/tob_pohskrow

## Goals
Participants will gain a general understanding of bots and why and when they can be useful, APIs (Twitter, specifically), and how to write a simple bot using Python. We will cover JSON and explain the data they can expect to see associated with each tweet. The workshop will be hands-on. Participants will modify provided code to search for tweets that interest them.

## Materials
We will provide starter code (IPython notebook) and example data.

## Preparation
Participants should have a Python environments with the following modules:

ipython (3.0.0)

TwitterAPI (2.3.3)

In addition, they need to request all required keys from Twitter. However, in the IPython notebook, we provide keys for a Twitter account we created specifically for this workshop.
