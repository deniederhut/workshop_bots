# workshop_bots
A repository for an upcoming D-Lab workshop on Twitter bots.

## Goals
Participants will gain a general understanding of bots and why and when they can be useful, APIs (Twitter, specifically), how to write a simple bot using Python, and how to analyze the data. We will cover JSON and explain the data they can expect to see associated with each tweet. The workshop will be hands-on. Participants will modify provided code to search for tweets that interest them.

## Materials
We will provide starter code and example data. We may include both a Python script and an IPython Notebook.

## Preparation
Participants should have a Python environments with the following modules:

In addition, they need to request all required keys from Twitter. In order to post to their accounts, additional verification is required. We may walk participants through this process, time permitting.
